# Potentiometer

The potentiometer is a really simple way to make the basic Blink program a lot more interesting. Turning the potentiometer 
will affect how fast the on-board LED blink.

As before, copy the 'ino' file into a new Arduino sketch and save it. 

## Wiring a Potentiometer

When we connected the LED, we used the digital pins - which only takes 1's and 0's. We're now going to use the analog pins,
which take a much wider range of values.

If you're looking to use a breadboard, here's an example of the schematic:

*Note that as long as the middle pin is connected to an analog pin, polarity does not need to be observed*
