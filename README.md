## Blink
Click [here](https://github.com/mitchpehora/canCode-Arduino/tree/master/blink) for information on making an LED blink! Supports on-board LED as well as external one.

## Potentiometer
Is that LED blinking too fast? Too slow? Reign it in with the use of a potentiometer. Click [here](https://github.com/mitchpehora/canCode-Arduino/tree/master/Potentiometer) for more info


## Button
Are you sick of that LED constantly flashing? Put a stop to that nonsense with the Button program, available [here](https://github.com/mitchpehora/canCode-Arduino/tree/master/Button).
